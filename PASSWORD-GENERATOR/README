Random Password Generator

This python script creates an arbitrarily password that relies on userâ€™s desired specifications like its length and types of characters it has.

Libraries and Modules

random: It is used to produce random numbers (in this case, random characters are selected).

string: It is used to define various character sets that can be employed in making passwords. For instance, ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation are some of the string constants made available by this module.

Functions

get_user_input():

It asks the user for the length of a password they want as well as whether or not it should contain letters, numbers, or symbols.

Changes input from user into boolean (include_letters, include_numbers, include_symbols) if it were y/n characters to become true/false values respectively.

validate_user_input(include_letters, include_numbers, include_symbols):

This checks if there is at least one character type selected by the user i.e letters/numbers/or/symbols.

If no character types have been selected by a user then return False and print an error message otherwise True.

generate_password(length, include_letters, include_numbers, include_symbols):

Creates a list of characters (character_pool) based on what options the user has chosen.

For creating a specific size password using random.choice() function randomly selects certain number of individual characters from character_pool.

main():

This performs all tasks that form the heart of this program:

Invokes get_user_input() to get those things that will please the client.
